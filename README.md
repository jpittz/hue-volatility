# hue-volatility

## Purpose

Prior to starting this project I had never used an external Python library or API. I've started this in order to build my Python skills and gain my first experience working with data from the internet and from my network locally in one project. To achieve this, I've decided to use a library for stock market data and for [Philips Hue](https://www.philips-hue.com/). Another factor for picking the two was that I find them interesting, and wanted to work with them.

## Aim

Initial aim was to have lights react to changes in either live or historical stock market data. (as of 7/8/23, completed 9/9/23)

Currently undecided on next the next project aim.
